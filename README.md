# Higher or lower game
##  Celebrity Edition of the game "Higher or Lower"

"Higher or lower — Celebrity edition" is a Python console game where you have to predict how many social media followers a particular star has. You will see two well-known people, and your task will be to determine which one of them has more followers on a well-known social media website. Try to complete all of the questions without providing an incorrect response before one.

## How to Play:
In your Python environment, run the script.

As you can see from the material provided, two celebrities named "A" and "B" have been detailed, along with their complete names, what they do, a brief description of them, and the nations to which they are native.

You must place a wager on which of these two celebrities has more admirers on popular social networking platforms. 

Fill in "A" if you're positive that Celeb A has more followers, and "B" if you're equally confident that Celeb B has the most followers.

What is the right response to the question "What will be revealed?" after making a guess?

Increase your score by making more guesses. Once you give a bad response, you will receive an indefinite timeout.


## Rules To start,

You have no points.

Score equals Score+1 if your assumption is correct.

If you make the erroneous guess, the game is ended and your final score is displayed.

If your input is accurate—and only if it is—the game will end.
